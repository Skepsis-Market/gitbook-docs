# What is Skepsis?

## The Problem with Traditional Prediction Markets

You're confident Bitcoin will be around $97,000 next week. You head to a prediction market and find:

> "Will Bitcoin hit $100,000 by Friday?"

You vote **No**. Bitcoin closes at $97,500. You were *right* about the price... but you still **lose** because the question was wrong for your belief.

**This is the problem with binary markets.** They force nuanced predictions into oversimplified yes/no boxes.

## Skepsis: Bet on Where, Not Just If

Skepsis is a **continuous outcome prediction market**. Instead of binary yes/no questions, you bet on **ranges**.

| Traditional Market | Skepsis Market |
|--------------------|----------------|
| "Will BTC hit $100K?" → Yes/No | "Where will BTC be?" → $95K-$98K |
| "Will it rain Saturday?" → Yes/No | "How much rain?" → 0.5-1.0 inches |
| "Will GPT-5 launch in 2025?" → Yes/No | "When will GPT-5 launch?" → March-June 2025 |

**Your prediction can finally match your actual belief.**
